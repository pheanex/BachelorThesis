Using a wireless backbone in a \ac{WDS} can be tricky as performance decreases with increasing size due to interference if 
channels and network topology are not selected carefully beforehand. Additionally network dissociations may occur easily if 
crucial links fail as redundancy is neglected.

Therefore we present an algorithm and its implementation which addresses this problem by finding a network topology and channel assignment 
that minimizes interference and thus allows a deployment to increase its throughput performance by utilizing more bandwidth in the local spectrum. 
Our evaluation results show an increase in throughput performance of up to 9 times or more compared to a baseline scenario where an optimization has not taken place
and only one channel for the whole network is used.
Furthermore our solution also provides a robust network topology which tackles the issue of network partition for single link failures by using survival paths.

We achieve this gain in performance by utilizing multi-radio accesspoints and enhancing the \ac{DJP}-algorithm for graphs by a scoring system combined with
a greedy channel assignment.
