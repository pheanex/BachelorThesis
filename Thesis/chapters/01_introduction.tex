\section{Motivation}
  We want to create an easily deployable \ac{WDS} for a set of accesspoints in order to create a wireless infrastructure for a specific area.
  Therefore we use AutoWDS which already does this, but currently in a very poor manner as throughput performance 
  and connectivity failures leave a lot to be desired. Our goal is to optimize its performance so that it's up to its job of routing a lot of data through its wireless backbone.
  We want to achieve this by utilizing multiple radios, channels and redundant links for establishing connections among the accesspoints.
  The problem we face doing this, and this work will elaborate on is, that a good selection of links and channels is not trivial even for a moderately sized scenario.
  To tackle this issue we use centrally run greedy algorithms to give us a very good solution to our problem.
