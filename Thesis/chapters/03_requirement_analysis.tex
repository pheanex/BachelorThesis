\chapter{Requirement Analysis}
General answer to question of feasibility
  \section{Increase Throughput}
  Has to maximize overall throughput\newline
  \section{Reduce Network Connectivity Failures}
\section{Utilize variable Number of Radios}
  Should utilize multiple Radios per AP\newline
  Currently homogenous 2, Later 3, sometimes just 1 \newline
  Also should be able to handle heterogenous environments with respect to number of equipped radios \newline
\section{Restrictions}
  \subsection{Centralized Computation}
    Run on central entity (WLC), not distributed \newline 
  \subsection{Static Environment}
    System is only used for static environments (APs are not mobile) \newline
\section{Economical Restrictions}
  Ressource restrictions (Processing Power limited) \newline
  Duration (Results have to be available in limited time) \newline
