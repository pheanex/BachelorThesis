\chapter{Design}
Feels like something important (sections) is still missing here \newline
Algorithm is split into two main sections: Topology creation and Channel assignment \newline
\section{Pre-Requirements for the Algorithms}
What is needed as input data for the Algorithm?
  Connected Topology => Connected Graph
\section{Topology Creation}
  Description of how the Topology creation works
  \subsection{Minimal/Optimal Spanning Tree Topology}
    Detailed explanation here
  \subsection{Survival Path}
    Detailed explanation here \newline
    Adding Redundant paths for stability \newline
    Flow Chart + Illustrated process + Verbal description \newline
\section{Channel Assignment Algorithm}
  Flow Chart + Illustrated process + Verbal description \cite{caa_tricky}
