What were the metrics of the test-runs?\newline
  \subsection{Durations}
  \subsection{Channelusage}
  \subsection{Characteristics}
    When did the tests take place?\newline
    Where?\newline
\section{Results}
\subsection{Expectations}
  What results would we expect?\newline
\subsection{Actual Results}
  Do the actual results diverge from the expected ones?\newline
  By how much is the solution better then before?
\section{Reflection on the requirements}
  How far does the solution meet the requirements?\newline
