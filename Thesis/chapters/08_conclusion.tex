\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Limitations}
  Where can't it be used?\newline
    For more volatile scenarios, where the APs are mobile or connectivity fluctuations are greater \newline
    For decentralized scenarios other solutions might be better (see related work) \newline
\section{Future Work}
  What is still to do?\newline
    Comparison to related work algorithms with actual measurements\newline
