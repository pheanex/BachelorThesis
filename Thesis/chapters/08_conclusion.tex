\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Limitations}
  The requirements analysis explicitly mentioned a static scenario only, therefore our solution won't yield good results for more volatile setups where link quality or network topology
  changes frequently. This would be the case for example if accesspoints were mobile.
  Since also a key requirement, this solution works best in a centralized managed scenario. For a distributed algorithm see related work.
\section{Future Work}
  Open issues which could not be addressed by us due to the lack of time, but nevertheless would like 
  to see implemented or tested are the following:
  \begin{description}
    \item [Further Evaluation]
      We are aware that our evaluation is more a proof of concept instead of an elaborate audit. As described we ran our throughput-tests only in our lab environment, 
      which was also designed with other metrics and scenarios in mind. Therefore a more thorough appraoch would include increased hardware diversity, in general the full scale
      testing of up to 100 devices and longer test-periods with varying deployment parameters like transmit-power, configuration timings and different topolgies.
      Especially simulating our solution with random graph layouts and different underlying topolgies could provide opportunities to even further increase throughput.
      Also the feature of evading foreign used channels should be evaluated if the implementation of AutoWDS permitts as this will be one of the factors which strongly affect performance.
    \item[Extensive Comparison to Related Work]
      As we only compared our work by listing features, a true comparison still has to be done if one would like to know the strength and weaknesses considering actual throughput-performance.
      As noted this will probably take quite some time as all the solutions would have to be implemented in presumably the same language. And then deciding on the environmental settings
      like interference by other devices and node connectivity will create new challenges.
    \item[Further Optimize Algorithms]
      Algorithm runtime is not in the focus of concern at the moment but could be in the future. As a result and in order to more closely integrate the solution into AutoWDS extended,
      porting the code to a native language like C/C++ could give some additional performance gains.
